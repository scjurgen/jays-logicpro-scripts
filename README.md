## delaytor

Create a MIDI-delay for notes that are held.

### Options

- repeat notes on different channel
- apply transpose value to delayed notes
- apply accent pattern
- freely programm accent pattern using notes C-2 .. B-2
- fade out/fade in of velocity
- apply random values
- harmonize random values
- select speed (i.e. 1/2, 1/4 etc.)

###Hints

The length accent works only when choosing the first accent option "Learn Notes".

The repetition rhythm is not quantized, meaning, if you play an arpeggio it will be repeated as arpeggio,
this can create interesting polyrhythmic effects.

I use the channel option with Kontakt 6, there you can assign 2 different Instruments on the same track on different channels..
